# Project: Visualizing Real World Data

## Overview

The goal of this project is to practice creating and interpreting different types of visualizations using real world data.

The dataset, I choose to work on is a dataset about video games set and their ratings which can be found here : https://www.kaggle.com/sidtwr/videogames-sales-dataset?select=Video_Games_Sales_as_at_22_Dec_2016.csv

## Objective

In this project, I will deal only with exploratory analysis i.e. the objective is to understand how the data about video games sales are distributed and generate insight for future decision-making. This analysis aims to explore as much as possible the data in a simple, intuitive and informative way.
